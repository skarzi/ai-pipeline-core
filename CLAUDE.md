# AI Pipeline Core Framework Requirements

> Internal requirements for the ai-pipeline-core framework repository. This document defines what the framework must provide and how framework code must be written.

## Design Principles

1. **Framework Absorbs Complexity, Apps Stay Simple** — All heavy/complex logic lives in the framework. Application code built on this framework should be minimal and straightforward. Execution tracking, retries, deployment, progress tracking, storage, logging, and validation are handled automatically.

2. **Deploy First, Optimize Later** — Get working system fast. Architecture must allow future optimization without major refactoring.

3. **Distributed by Default** — Multiple processes on independent machines with centralized services (LiteLLM, ClickHouse, logging). Design to avoid race conditions and data duplication.

4. **AI-Native Development** — Designed for AI coding agents to understand, modify, and debug. One correct way to do everything. Definition-time validation catches mistakes before runtime.

5. **Single Source of Truth** — No duplicate documentation. Code defines behavior. Auto-generate documentation from code.

6. **Self-Explanatory Code** — Code must be understandable without deep-diving into documentation or framework source code. Naming, structure, and types make intent obvious.

7. **Automate Everything Possible** — If a check, validation, or transformation can be automated, it must be. Manual steps invite errors.

8. **Minimal Code** — Less code is better code. Every line must justify its existence.

9. **No Legacy Code** — No backward compatibility layers, deprecation shims, or references to previous implementations. Unused code must be removed immediately.

10. **No Unvalidatable Derivatives** — When a value is derived from a typed source (field name, class name, enum variant), it must be computed programmatically, not written as a manual string. Dict keys mirroring model fields, string identifiers mirroring class names — if the type checker can't trace it back to the source, derive it from the typed source instead. This prevents silent breakage when renaming.

11. **Sequential phases, not if/elif branches** — When logic is "try A, then fall back to B if A is insufficient," write it as two sequential blocks with a condition between them — not `if A: ... elif B: ...` which duplicates the B logic and obscures the relationship.

## 1. Core Architecture

### 1.1 Async Execution

All operations must be asynchronous. No blocking I/O calls allowed.

**`async def` must contain async operations** — Functions declared with `async def` must contain at least one `await`, `async for`, or `async with` statement. Functions without async operations must not be marked `async`. Enforced via semgrep rule.

**Exceptions:**
- Protocol stubs (method signature only)
- ABC base class methods meant for override
- In-memory test implementations (e.g., MemoryDatabase)

### 1.2 Immutability & Safety

- No mutable global variables (constants or initialized-once immutable globals only)
- Default timeouts on all operations — nothing hangs indefinitely
- Strict type checking throughout
- Pydantic models use `frozen=True` where possible
- Dataclasses use `frozen=True` and `slots=True`

### 1.3 Module System

- Modules/agents/tools form **acyclic dependency graph**
- Clear module boundaries with defined inputs/outputs
- Task inputs support typed parameters: scalars, enums, frozen BaseModels, `Conversation`, `Document`, and typed containers thereof
- **Context as document types** — Prompt specs declare `input_documents: tuple[type[Document], ...]` for expected context
- Missing documents warned at runtime (via `send_spec()`)

### 1.4 Configuration

- System-level config via `Settings` base class (Pydantic BaseSettings)
- Module-level overrides when needed
- No config duplication — define once, reuse everywhere
- Model configuration includes model name AND model-specific options (e.g., `reasoning_effort`)

---

## 2. What the Framework Provides

### 2.1 LLM Interaction (`llm/`, `_llm_core/`)

**Conversation Class (public API for all LLM interactions):**
- Immutable, stateful conversation management
- Separates **context** (cacheable prefix: documents, system instructions) from **messages** (dynamic suffix: conversation history)
- **Immutability**: Every method returns a NEW `Conversation` instance. The original is never modified. This enables safe forking for warmup+fork pattern.
- **Methods**: `send(content)`, `send_structured(content, response_format)`, `send_spec(spec, documents=...)`, `with_document(doc)`, `with_documents(docs)`, `with_context(*docs)`, `with_model(model)`, `with_model_options(options)`, `with_substitutor(enabled)`, `with_assistant_message(content)`
- **Properties**: `.content`, `.reasoning_content`, `.usage`, `.cost`, `.parsed`, `.citations`, `.approximate_tokens_count`

**Prompt Caching:**
- Automatic prefix-based caching via `cache_ttl` parameter (default: 5 minutes)
- Warmup + fork pattern supported (see §3.2 for implementation details)
- **WARNING: Gemini requires ≥10k tokens in context for caching to be effective**

**Image Handling:**
- Automatic processing for images exceeding 3000x3000 pixels
- `ImagePreset` enum for per-model optimization (framework handles downscaling internally)
- Tall images: split vertically into tiles with 20% overlap
- Wide images: trimmed (left-aligned crop)
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP. Re-encoded as WebP only when processing is needed; images within model limits are sent in original format.

**Model Options:**
- `ModelOptions` — `reasoning_effort`, `cache_ttl`, `retries`, `timeout`, `system_prompt`, `temperature`, `max_completion_tokens`, `stop`, and provider-specific options

**Output Degeneration Detection:**
- Automatic detection of token repetition loops in LLM responses
- Raises `OutputDegenerationError` (subclass of `LLMError`) when degeneration is detected
- Integrated with retry loop — degenerate responses trigger retries with cache disabled

**Resilience:**
- Configurable retries with fixed delay (`retry_delay_seconds`, default 20s). Cache disabled on retry to avoid repeating cached failures.
- Model fallbacks (primary → secondary → tertiary) — configured via LiteLLM
- Provider fallbacks (OpenAI → Gemini → Grok) — configured via LiteLLM

**Content Protection:**
- `URLSubstitutor` — Handles URLs, blockchain addresses, and high-entropy strings via two-tier shortening
- Entropy-based detection identifies strings that are likely tokens/keys
- Enabled by default in `Conversation`; auto-disabled for `-search` suffix models
- Both `.content` and `.parsed` are eagerly restored after every `send()`/`send_structured()` call — no manual restoration needed

### 2.2 Documents (`documents/`)

**Document Class:**
- Immutable Pydantic model wrapping binary content with metadata
- SHA256 content-addressed storage (deduplication)
- MIME type detection (extension-based + content analysis)
- Automatic content conversion: `str | bytes | dict | list | BaseModel` → bytes
- `derive(from_documents=..., name=..., content=...)` — Convenience method for creating documents from other documents (extracts SHA256 hashes automatically). The 95% API path.

**Provenance Tracking:**
- `derived_from` — Content provenance (document SHA256 hashes or URLs)
- `triggered_by` — Causal provenance (document SHA256 hashes only)
- Validation: same SHA256 cannot appear in both derived_from and triggered_by

**Definition-Time Validation (`__init_subclass__`):**
- Rejects class names starting with "Test" (pytest conflict)
- Rejects custom fields beyond allowed set (`name`, `description`, `summary`, `content`, `derived_from`, `triggered_by`, `attachments`)
- Detects canonical name collisions between Document subclasses
- Validates `FILES` enum if defined

**Attachments:**
- `Attachment` class for multi-part documents (e.g., markdown + screenshot + PDF)
- Primary content in `Document.content`, secondary in `attachments` tuple
- Properties: `mime_type`, `is_image`, `is_pdf`, `is_text`, `size`, `text`

### 2.3 Pipeline Classes (`pipeline/`)

**`PipelineTask` base class:**
- Subclass with `@classmethod async def run(cls, documents: tuple[...]) -> tuple[...]`
- Automatic execution-node tracking and document persistence to the active database backend
- Document lifecycle tracking (created, returned, orphaned)
- Configurable retries, timeouts via ClassVars

**`PipelineFlow` base class:**
- Subclass with `async def run(self, documents: tuple[...], options: FlowOptions) -> tuple[...]`
- Extracts input/output document types from `run()` annotations at class definition time
- Validates: exactly 3 parameters (`self`, `documents`, `options`), correct types, no input/output type overlap
- Use `get_run_id()` from `ai_pipeline_core.pipeline` to access the current run ID inside a flow or task (RunContext is set by the deployment runtime in `deployment/base.py`)

**`PipelineTask` Return Type Validation:**
- Return type must be `Document | None | list[Document] | tuple[Document, ...]`
- Rejects mixed types (e.g., `str | Document`)
- Rejects invalid containers (e.g., `dict[str, Document]`)

**`PipelineFlow` Return Type Validation:**
- Return type must be `tuple[Document, ...]` (e.g., `tuple[MyDoc, ...]` or `tuple[DocA | DocB, ...]`)
- Enforced at both definition time and runtime

**`traced_operation()` helper:**
- `async with traced_operation(name, description=""):` creates a lightweight traced `OPERATION` span inside an active deployment run
- No-op outside deployment/database context
- Nested spans are supported, and `Conversation.send()` calls inside the span become child `CONVERSATION` nodes whose metrics roll up onto the span node

**Execution Hierarchy:**
- Span kinds: `DEPLOYMENT`, `FLOW`, `TASK`, `OPERATION`, `CONVERSATION`, `LLM_ROUND`, `TOOL_CALL` (7 total)
- Primary execution tree: `DEPLOYMENT -> FLOW -> TASK -> CONVERSATION`; `OPERATION` spans are created by `traced_operation()` as nested spans within the task branch
- `CONVERSATION` spans contain child `LLM_ROUND` and `TOOL_CALL` spans for detailed LLM interaction tracking
- `previous_conversation_id` links each conversation node to the immediately preceding conversation in the same chain; sequential sends form a linked list, and forks point to the shared parent or warmup node

**Graceful Degradation:**
- `safe_gather(*coros)` / `safe_gather_indexed(*coros)` execute coroutines in parallel, logging individual failures while returning successes
- By default raises `RuntimeError` if all tasks fail (`raise_if_all_fail=True`)
- Document persistence failures in `PipelineTask` are logged as warnings, not errors

### 2.4 Database (`database/`)

**Public API — `DatabaseReader` protocol** (read-only, exported at top level):
- Load and query spans, documents, blobs, deployments, and logs
- Power replay, `ai-trace`, and downloaded `FilesystemDatabase` snapshots

**SpanRecord Shape:**
- `SpanRecord` stores hierarchy via `parent_span_id`, with `root_deployment_id` for tree queries and `previous_conversation_id` for conversation-chain reconstruction
- Span kinds are exactly `deployment`, `flow`, `task`, `operation`, `conversation`, `llm_round`, and `tool_call`
- Conversation chains and warmup/fork trees are reconstructed from `previous_conversation_id`; replay state is stored across span fields (`target`, `receiver_json`, `input_json`, `output_json`, `meta_json`, `metrics_json`) and child spans

**`DatabaseWriter` protocol** (exported from `ai_pipeline_core.database`, full read/write):
- Adds append-only write operations used by `PipelineTask`, deployments, replay, and execution logging
- `supports_remote: bool` property — indicates whether the backend supports Prefect-based remote deployment execution

**Backends** (class names are public, residing in internal modules):
- `ClickHouseDatabase` (production, `database/clickhouse/`), `FilesystemDatabase` (CLI/download/replay, `database/filesystem/`), `MemoryDatabase` (testing, exported from `database/`)
- Downloaded `FilesystemDatabase` snapshots persist span JSON files under `runs/`, document metadata under `documents/`, blobs under `blobs/`, and logs in `logs.jsonl`

### 2.5 Deployment (`deployment/`)

**PipelineDeployment Base Class:**
- Generic typing: `PipelineDeployment[TOptions, TResult]`
- Per-flow resume via database-backed execution nodes (explicit flow completion records, configurable `cache_ttl`)
- Per-flow uploads (not just at pipeline end)
- Pub/Sub event publishing (per-flow start/completion via `PUBSUB_PROJECT_ID`, `PUBSUB_TOPIC_ID` environment variables on `Settings`)
- CLI interface with `--start`/`--end` step control
- Prefect deployment generation via `as_prefect_flow()`
- Deployment execution trees follow `DEPLOYMENT -> FLOW -> TASK -> CONVERSATION`; `traced_operation()` inserts additional nested `OPERATION` spans inside the active flow/task branch when needed

**RemoteDeployment:**
- Typed client for calling a remote `PipelineDeployment` via Prefect
- Generic typing: `RemoteDeployment[TOptions, TResult]` (2 type parameters: options and result)

**Progress Tracking:**
- Automatic flow-level progress derived from execution state and `estimated_minutes` on each `PipelineFlow`
- Pub/Sub events (`FlowStartedEvent`/`FlowCompletedEvent`) report step/total_steps

**Concurrency Limits:**
- `PipelineLimit` and `LimitKind` for declaring cross-run concurrency/rate limits
- `pipeline_concurrency(name)` async context manager at call sites
- `LimitKind.CONCURRENT` — Lease-based slots
- `LimitKind.PER_MINUTE` / `PER_HOUR` — Token bucket rate limits
- Auto-created in Prefect at pipeline start; unthrottled when Prefect unavailable

### 2.6 Prompt Compiler (`prompt_compiler/`)

**PromptSpec Class:**
- Type-safe prompt specifications replacing Jinja2 templates
- Typed Python classes for roles, rules, guides, and output formats
- Definition-time validation at import time (not runtime)
- ClassVars: `role`, `task`, `input_documents`, `rules`, `guides`, `output_rules`, `output_structure`
- Dynamic fields via Pydantic `Field()` — short, single-line values inlined in Context section (max 500 chars; longer/multiline values are auto-promoted to multi-line treatment with a warning)
- Multi-line fields via `MultiLineField(description=...)` — combined into a single XML-tagged user message (`<field_name>value</field_name>`) sent before the main prompt, referenced in Context as "(provided in <tag> tags in previous message)"

**Components** (define once, reuse across specs):
- `Role` — Actor definition ("experienced research analyst")
- `Rule` — Behavioral constraints ("always cite evidence")
- `OutputRule` — Output format constraints ("no markdown tables")
- `Guide` — Reference material loaded from file at import time

**Follow-up Chains:**
- `follows=ParentSpec` keyword on `__init_subclass__` to declare follow-up specs
- Follow-up specs don't require `role` or `input_documents`
- Documents go to messages instead of context for follow-ups

**Rendering:**
- `render_text(spec, documents=...)` — Render prompt to string (multi-line fields excluded, shown as references)
- `render_multi_line_messages(spec)` — Returns `list[tuple[str, str]]` of `(field_name, xml_block)` pairs for multi-line fields
- `render_preview(spec_class)` — Preview with placeholder values; multi-line fields shown as XML blocks before `---` separator, then the main prompt
- `Conversation.send_spec(spec, documents=...)` — Send to LLM (auto-dispatches text/structured); multi-line fields added as user messages automatically

**Output Structure:**
- `output_structure` enables `<result>` tag wrapping and stop sequence at `</result>`
- Auto-extracted in `Conversation.content` property — `conv.content` returns clean text
- `PromptSpec[SomeModel]` uses `send_structured()` automatically

**CLI Tool** (`ai-prompt-compiler`):
- `inspect SpecName` — Spec anatomy (role, docs, fields, rules, token estimate)
- `render SpecName` — Render prompt preview
- `compile` — Discover, list, and compile all specs to `.prompts/` directory

### 2.7 Observability (`observability/`)

**Execution Data:**
- Execution structure is stored in `spans`
- Execution logs are stored in `logs`
- LLM calls persist full prompt/response payloads across span fields (`input_json`, `output_json`, `meta_json`, `metrics_json`) for debugging and replay. Conversation spans include both base `model_options` (for replay) and `effective_model_options` (for audit). Multimodal content in `request_messages` uses `{"$doc_ref": "<sha256>"}` references to the `blobs` table instead of inline base64.

**CLI:**
- `ai-trace list` lists deployments from the database
- `ai-trace show <id>` renders the execution tree plus logs, with `CONVERSATION` leaf lines showing purpose, duration, model, token counts, cache hits, and cost
- `ai-trace download <id> -o <output-dir>` exports a portable `FilesystemDatabase` snapshot plus summary artifacts such as `summary.md`, `costs.md`, `llm_calls.jsonl`, `errors.md` (when failures exist), and `documents.md` (when documents exist)

**Logging API** (in `logger/` module, not `observability/`):
- `get_pipeline_logger()` — Configured logger with context
- `ExecutionLogHandler` — stdlib logging handler that routes root-logger records into the active execution log buffer, persisted to `logs` during deployment runs
- Logs flow into the database-backed execution log pipeline automatically during deployment runs

### 2.8 Replay (`replay/`)

**Automatic capture and re-execution of any pipeline boundary** — every LLM conversation, `PipelineTask`, and `PipelineFlow` call records replayable state across span fields (`target`, `input_json`, `output_json`, `meta_json`) plus child spans.

**Replay Entry Points:**
- Task replay loads the task class from `target`, resolves `$doc_ref` arguments from the database, and executes the task
- Flow replay loads the flow class from `target`, resolves input documents, and executes the flow
- Conversation replay reconstructs prior history from `previous_conversation_id` plus child `llm_round` and `tool_call` spans

**Document References** — documents are referenced by SHA256 (`$doc_ref`), resolved from a `DatabaseReader` during replay. This includes both task arguments and multimodal content (images, PDFs) in LLM round `request_messages`.

**CLI Tool** (`ai-replay`): `run --from-db <span_id>` executes a replay, and `show --from-db <span_id>` inspects one. File inputs are span JSON files from downloaded snapshots. Passing a directory is rejected with guidance to use `--from-db` or a span JSON file. Supports `--db-path`, `--set KEY=VALUE`, `--import MODULE`, and `--output-dir`.

**Output:** Results are saved to `output_dir/output.yaml`. Downloaded bundles remain replayable by pointing `--db-path` at the exported `FilesystemDatabase` root.

## 3. LLM Implementation Rules

These rules govern how the framework's LLM module must be implemented.

### 3.1 Token Economics — Input Tokens Are Cheap

**Core principle:** Input tokens are cheap; cached input tokens are near-free. Never sacrifice accuracy or context quality to reduce input size. Full context improves accuracy and is cheap.

The framework must:
- Support large contexts (100K-250K tokens)
- **Never trim or summarize inputs** to "save tokens"
- Implement prefix-based caching with configurable TTL
- Prefer sending identical large prefixes across calls over sending tailored smaller prompts per call

### 3.2 Warmup + Fork Pattern

When multiple LLM calls share the same context, the framework must support the warmup + fork pattern:

1. **Warmup call**: Send shared context with a short warmup message. This populates the cache.
2. **Capture warmup response**: The LLM acknowledges. **This response must be kept** — it becomes part of the shared prefix for all forks.
3. **Fork**: Create N parallel calls. Each fork's messages start with the warmup conversation (warmup message + warmup response), then append per-fork content.

**Critical**: The warmup response is essential. Without it, fork messages diverge immediately after the warmup message — the provider only caches `context + warmup message` (a few hundred tokens). With it, the cached prefix includes `context + warmup message + warmup response`. Discarding the warmup response defeats the purpose of the warmup call.

**Timing constraint**: All forked calls must be sent within 5 minutes of the warmup call (cache TTL).

### 3.3 Preparation-First Execution

Because cache lives at most 5 minutes, the framework must support preparation-first execution:

1. **Fetch phase**: Gather all external data (web content, screenshots, API responses)
2. **Warmup phase**: Send shared context to LLM
3. **Execution phase**: Fire all forked LLM calls simultaneously

**Anti-pattern**: Interleaving slow I/O with LLM calls causes cache misses because later calls may arrive after cache TTL expires.

### 3.4 No Batching

Do not batch multiple items into a single LLM call to "save tokens." With caching:
- Separate calls are nearly as cheap as batched calls (shared prefix is cached)
- Separate calls produce higher accuracy (LLM focuses on one task)
- Separate calls are easier to implement, retry, and debug
- Separate calls return structured output per item without complex parsing

### 3.5 Image Handling

Maximum image resolution is 3000x3000 pixels. The framework handles per-model downscaling internally via `ImagePreset`.

**Image Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Load and normalize** — EXIF orientation fix (important for mobile photos)
2. **If within model limits** — Send in original format as single image
3. **If taller than limit** — Split vertically into tiles with **20% overlap**, each tile within height limit
4. **If wider than limit** — Trim width (left-aligned crop). Web content is left-aligned, so right-side content is typically less important.
5. **Describe the split in text prompt** — "Screenshot was split into N sequential parts with overlap"

The framework must:
- Process images up to 3000x3000 maximum, with per-model downscaling via `ImagePreset`
- Apply **20% overlap** between vertical tiles to prevent content loss at boundaries
- Supported image formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP (all accepted by current providers)
- Prefer larger tiles to minimize token cost

### 3.6 Model Cost Tiers

The framework should guide apps toward cost-effective model selection:

- **Expensive** (pro/flagship): gemini-3-pro, gpt-5.1. Use for complex reasoning, final synthesis.
- **Cheap** (flash/fast): gemini-3-flash, grok-4.1-fast. Use for high-volume tasks, formatting, conversion, structured output extraction.
- **Too small** (nano/lite): Insufficient for production pipeline tasks. Do not use.

### 3.7 Model Reference Preservation

**Do not remove model references that appear unfamiliar.** Models are released frequently and the codebase may reference models that are newer than the AI coding agent's training data. If a model name exists in code, assume it is valid unless there is concrete evidence otherwise (e.g., provider returns "model not found" error).

### 3.8 Structured Output

`Conversation.send_structured()` must:
- Accept Pydantic BaseModel as `response_format`
- Send schema to LLM automatically (never explain JSON structure in prompts)
- Parse and validate response against model
- Return a new `Conversation` with `.parsed` property returning the typed model instance

**Quality limits**:
- Structured outputs degrade beyond ~2-3K tokens
- Nesting beyond 2 levels causes quality degradation
- `dict` types are not supported in structured output — use lists of typed models
- Complex structures should be split across multiple calls

**Decomposition Fields Before Decision Fields:**
In BaseModel definitions, fields that decompose the problem into concrete dimensions must be defined before fields that represent conclusions. LLMs generate tokens sequentially — if the decision field comes first, the LLM commits to a conclusion and then rationalizes it.

```python
# WRONG — decision before analysis
class VerificationResult(BaseModel):
    is_valid: bool
    summary: str

# WRONG — generic scratchpad
class VerificationResult(BaseModel):
    reasoning: str  # Just "think step by step" in a field
    is_valid: bool

# CORRECT — domain-specific decomposition leads to decision
class VerificationResult(BaseModel):
    source_content_summary: str   # What the source says
    report_claims: str            # What the report claims
    discrepancies: str            # Differences found
    assessment: str               # Reasoned conclusion
    is_valid: bool                # Decision follows from decomposition
```

### 3.9 Document XML Wrapping

When documents are added to LLM context, the framework wraps them:

```xml
<document>
  <id>A7B2C9</id>
  <name>report.md</name>
  <description>Research report</description>
  <content>
  [full document text]
  </content>
</document>
```

This XML boundary separates data from instructions — the **prompt injection defense**. The system prompt instructs the LLM to treat document content as data, not executable instructions.

**All structured data for LLM context must be wrapped in a Document** — use `Document.create()` (requires provenance via `derived_from` or `triggered_by`) or `Document.create_root(reason=...)` (for pipeline inputs without provenance) to wrap dicts, lists, or BaseModel instances. Never construct XML manually (e.g., f-string `<document>` tags). The framework handles escaping, ID generation, and consistent formatting.

### 3.10 Thinking Models

All LLMs (2026) perform internal reasoning. The framework must NOT add:
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- "Think step by step" instructions
- Scratchpad patterns

These are redundant and can interfere with the model's native reasoning. Reasoning effort is controlled via `ModelOptions.reasoning_effort` where supported.

### 3.11 Long Response Handling

LLMs produce quality degradation in responses longer than 3-5K tokens. The framework must support:
- Conversational follow-up patterns for building long outputs incrementally
- Multi-turn exchanges where each follow-up receives previous responses as conversation history

Tasks requiring long outputs should not use a single call requesting a large response.

### 3.12 LLM Anti-Patterns

The framework must **not** implement or encourage these patterns:

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong |
|--------------|----------------|
| Batching multiple items in one call | Caching makes separate calls nearly as cheap; accuracy degrades with batching |
| Generic `reasoning: str` scratchpad fields | Redundant with model's native reasoning; use domain-specific decomposition fields |
| Chain-of-thought prompting | All 2026 models are thinking models; explicit CoT is redundant |
| Numeric confidence scores without criteria | Each call interprets scale differently; hallucinated results |
| Trimming inputs to "save tokens" | Input tokens are cheap; context improves accuracy |
| Explaining JSON structure in prompts | Redundant with schema sent via `response_format`; degrades quality |

## 4. Code Quality Standards

### 4.1 Type Safety

- Complete type hints on all functions and return values
- Pydantic models for all data structures
- Use specific types: `UUID` not `str` for identifiers, `Path` not `str` for file paths
- Constrained strings must be custom types (NewType, Annotated, or wrapper class)
- Definition-time validation via `__init_subclass__` where applicable

### 4.2 Testing

- Tests serve as usage examples
- Test mode allows running with cheaper/faster models (simple model swap via config)
- Individual modules must be testable in isolation
- Framework provides test harness utilities requiring zero configuration

**Test-First Bug Fixing:**
When a bug is discovered, write a failing test first. The test must assert the **correct** behavior and be marked `@pytest.mark.xfail(reason="...", strict=True)` so it proves the bug exists (xfail = expected failure). Only then implement the fix. After fixing, remove the `xfail` marker — the test becomes a permanent regression guard that prevents the bug from reappearing.

**No Suppression of Tooling Warnings:**
When linters, type checkers, semgrep, tests, or CI/CD checks report an issue, investigate it fully and fix the root cause. Never use shortcuts: no `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `# nosemgrep`, `pytest.skip()`, `xfail` (except for TDD bug proving above), disabling rules, commenting out code, deleting the check, or any other form of suppression. These tools detect real coding problems — silencing them hides bugs instead of fixing them. If a warning is genuinely a false positive, document why in a comment next to the narrowest possible suppression (single line, specific rule code).

### 4.3 AI-Focused Documentation

The framework auto-generates documentation for AI coding agents via `docs_generator/`:
- Public/private determined by `_` prefix convention
- Full source code with comments included
- Examples extracted from test suite
- 40KB warning threshold per guide
- CI-enforced freshness

**Visibility by Naming Convention:**
- No `_` prefix → public (included in docs)
- Single `_` prefix → private (excluded)
- Dunder methods (`__init__`, `__eq__`, etc.) → always public
- Files starting with `_` (e.g., `_helpers.py`) → private modules (excluded entirely)
- Exception: `__init__.py` is always processed

**Docstring Rules:**
- No `Example:` blocks — tests serve as examples
- Inline comments within method bodies are preserved

**Test Marking:**
- `@pytest.mark.ai_docs` — Explicitly include a test as an example
- Marked tests get priority — included first regardless of score
- Auto-selected tests are scored by: symbol overlap (high bonus), test length (shorter preferred), mock usage (penalty)
- Error examples using `pytest.raises` included in ERROR EXAMPLES section

**Internal Types:**
- Private classes matching `_CapitalizedName` pattern that appear in public API signatures are automatically included in INTERNAL TYPES section
- Ensures guides are self-contained

**Guide Structure Rules:**
- Every guide includes `## Imports` with two-tier import paths: `from ai_pipeline_core import ...` (top-level) and `from ai_pipeline_core.<module> import ...` (sub-package symbols not at top level)
- Module-level `NewType`, `type` aliases, and public `UPPER_CASE` constants must be extracted into `## Types & Constants` section
- `.ai-docs/README.md` (generated) includes comprehensive per-module API summaries with all public symbols
- When `__init_subclass__` calls private helpers, the class docstring must enumerate all constraints as rule lines
- Prefer `class MyType(str)` over `NewType` for types that should appear in documentation with their own docstring
- Protocol and Enum classes are tagged with a comment line (`# Protocol` / `# Enum`) above the class definition

### 4.4 Module Cohesion

Each framework module produces one AI-docs guide. That guide must be **self-sufficient for usage**: an AI coding agent must be able to correctly use the module's public API by reading only that guide.

**The acid test**: "Can an AI agent correctly use this module by reading only its guide?" If using module A requires reading module B's guide, the module boundaries must be redrawn.

- **One concern, one module** — Related functionality lives in a single module directory
- **Public API self-documentation** — Parameters triggering behavior in other modules must be documented on the public API
- **Imports allowed, knowledge dependencies forbidden** — Module A may import from B internally, but using A's public API must not require reading B's documentation

---

## 5. Code Hygiene Rules

### 5.1 Protocol and Implementation Separation

Protocol definitions must not be mixed with implementations in the same file. When a Protocol is needed, place it in a separate `_protocols.py` or `_types.py` module.

**Exceptions:** Files explicitly excluded in semgrep config (protocol.py, base.py, _types.py).

### 5.2 No Patch Reference Comments

Comments referencing bug fixes (`# FIX 1:`, `# Fixes #123`, `# Fixes issue`, `# Patch for...`, `# Workaround for...`) are forbidden. Code must be self-explanatory. Bug fixes are documented by regression tests.

### 5.3 Magic Number Constants

Numeric literals used as thresholds, limits, or configuration values must be defined as module-level or class-level constants with descriptive names.

**Exceptions:** `0`, `1`, `-1`, `2`, and standard mathematical constants.

```python
# Wrong
if len(url) < 40:
    return url

# Correct
MIN_URL_LENGTH_FOR_SHORTENING = 40
```

### 5.4 Silent Exception Handling

`except Exception: pass` and `except: pass` are forbidden. Caught exceptions must be:
1. Logged with context, OR
2. Re-raised (possibly wrapped), OR
3. Converted to a specific return value with a comment explaining why swallowing is safe

### 5.5 File Size Limits

- **Warning:** Files exceeding 500 lines (excluding blanks and comments)
- **Error:** Files exceeding 1000 lines

**Suggested splits:**
- Types/protocols → `_types.py` or `_protocols.py`
- Pure functions/utilities → `_utils.py`
- Constants/patterns → `_constants.py`

### 5.6 Export Discipline

Every module with public symbols must define `__all__` listing its public API. Internal modules must be prefixed with `_` (e.g., `_helpers.py`).

### 5.7 Module Naming

Module and directory names must describe the domain problem, not implementation technique.

**Anti-pattern:** `content_protection/` (describes technique)
**Correct:** `token_reduction/` or `url_shortener/` (describes purpose)

### 5.8 Algorithm Complexity

Operations on unbounded input should prefer O(n) or O(n log n). O(n²) is acceptable only when:
- Input size has a known small bound (e.g., n ≤ 100), AND
- The simpler algorithm reduces code complexity

Document size assumptions when using higher-complexity algorithms.

### 5.9 Duplicate Logic

Functions or match/case blocks with >80% structural similarity must be consolidated. Use parameterization, helper functions, or lookup tables.

### 5.10 Actionable Error and Warning Messages

Warning and error messages must include not only what went wrong, but also how to fix it and how to do it correctly. The reader (often an AI coding agent) should be able to resolve the issue from the message alone without consulting documentation.

```python
# Wrong — states the problem but not the solution
logger.warning("Field '%s' value is too long (%d chars).", field_name, len(value))

# Correct — states the problem, the correct usage, and how to fix it
logger.warning(
    "PromptSpec '%s' field '%s' has a long or multiline value (%d chars). "
    "Field parameters are for short, single-line values (up to %d chars). "
    "Pass longer content as a Document via input_documents and send_spec(documents=[...]).",
    spec_name, field_name, len(value), MAX_LENGTH,
)
```

## 6. Deployment & Operations

### 6.1 Deployment Safety

- New deployments must not break running workflows
- Running processes finish on old version
- New requests use new version
- Graceful version transition

### 6.2 Scalability

- Horizontal scaling via additional workers
- Centralized services handle coordination (LiteLLM, ClickHouse)
- No single points of failure (where possible)
- Deployment system should be able to manage resources (API keys, models, scaling)

## 7. Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Orchestrator | Prefect | Flow/task orchestration, state management |
| LLM Proxy | LiteLLM (primary), OpenRouter (compatible) | Unified multi-provider access |
| Database | ClickHouse (production), filesystem (CLI/replay), in-memory (testing) | Unified storage: `spans`, `documents`, `blobs`, `logs`. Content-addressed with SHA256 deduplication |

---

## 8. Not Yet Implemented

These features are planned but not implemented:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Anomaly Detection | Detect model hangs, malformed responses, incorrect outputs. (Output degeneration / response loops ARE implemented via `_degeneration.py`.) |
| Checkpoint Granularity | Module-level, task-level, or call-level recovery |
| Three-Tier Parameter System | Context Documents (schema at def, content at runtime), Static Parameters (compile time), Dynamic Parameters (runtime) |

---

## 9. Out of Scope

- Compliance/regulatory features (GDPR, SOC2)
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Complex access control/RBAC
- Custom orchestrator implementation

## 10. Test Running Guidelines

### Infrastructure tests auto-skip
ClickHouse, Pub/Sub, and LLM integration tests auto-skip when their requirements are unavailable. No flags or marker exclusions needed — `pytest tests/deployment/ -x -q` is always safe to run even without Docker.

### NEVER pipe pytest output through grep, head, tail, or any filter
These cause buffering hangs. Use pytest's native flags instead.

### NEVER run the full test suite (`pytest tests/`) for small changes
The full suite has 3000+ tests and takes 3-5 minutes. Run only the relevant test directory:

| Changed source | Test command |
|---|---|
| `ai_pipeline_core/documents/` | `pytest tests/documents/ -x -q` |
| `ai_pipeline_core/llm/` | `pytest tests/llm/ -x -q` |
| `ai_pipeline_core/pipeline/` | `pytest tests/pipeline/ -x -q` |
| `ai_pipeline_core/deployment/` | `pytest tests/deployment/ -x -q` |
| `ai_pipeline_core/database/` | `pytest tests/database/ -x -q` |
| `ai_pipeline_core/prompt_compiler/` | `pytest tests/prompt_compiler/ -x -q` |
| `ai_pipeline_core/observability/` | `pytest tests/observability/ -x -q` |
| `ai_pipeline_core/replay/` | `pytest tests/replay/ -x -q` |

### Use -x to stop on first failure
`pytest tests/pipeline/ -x -q` — fix one failure at a time.

### Use --lf to rerun only failures
After a failed run, `pytest --lf -x -q` reruns only what failed last time.

### Use --testmon to only run tests affected by your changes
`pytest --testmon -q` — testmon tracks which source lines each test covers and only reruns affected tests. A cached run with no changes takes ~5 seconds instead of minutes. The `.testmondata` file persists across runs.

### Full suite validation (rare — only before final commit/PR)
`pytest -n auto --dist worksteal -q` — parallel execution across all cores.

### pytest output flags (no grep needed)
- `--tb=no` — pass/fail counts only
- `--tb=line` — one line per failure
- `--tb=short` — short tracebacks (default in pyproject.toml)
- `-q` — quiet mode, minimal output

## 11. Bash Guidelines

### IMPORTANT: Avoid commands that cause output buffering issues
- DO NOT pipe output through `head`, `tail`, `less`, `more`, or `grep` when monitoring or checking command output
- DO NOT use `| head -n X` or `| tail -n X` to truncate output - these cause buffering problems
- Instead, let commands complete fully, or use `--max-lines` flags if the command supports them
- For log monitoring, prefer reading files directly rather than piping through filter

### When checking command output:
- Run commands directly without pipes when possible
- If you need to limit output, use command-specific flags (e.g., `git log -n 10` instead of `git log | head -10`)
- Avoid chained pipes that can cause output to buffer indefinitely
